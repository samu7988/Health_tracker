# Health Tracker


:star: [Health Tracker](https://github.com/samu7988/Health_tracker/tree/main/Health_tracker) is a low power embedded system designed to measure heartbeat and detect free-fall.

> **Goal**
> 
> In a world where safety meets innovation,  Health Tracker Project takes center stage. Imagine a scenario where a person's well-being is monitored beyond the ordinary â€“ not just heartbeats, but even the unexpected. Free fall events, those moments when someone needs help the most, are now under the vigilant watch of our technology..

## Project Proposal

### Goal

The goal of this project is to emulate a health tracker capable of monitoring pulse rate (heartbeats) and detecting free falls. The captured data is then sent to a smartphone application via Bluetooth Low Energy protocol. The pulse rates are captured using a pulse rate sensor from Sparkfun, while free falls are detected using an accelerometer.

### Student Names

- Sayali Mule (sayali.mule@colorado.edu)

### Project Overview

Team 16 has chosen to proceed with option 1. The project involves creating a system with a server (Blue Gecko board) and a client (mobile phone application) to monitor pulse rates and detect free falls. The server communicates the collected data to the client via BLE protocol.
