# Health Tracker


:star: [Health Tracker](https://github.com/samu7988/Health_tracker/tree/main/Health_tracker) is a low power embedded system designed to measure heartbeat and detect free-fall.

> **Goal**
> 
> In a world where safety meets innovation,  Health Tracker Project takes center stage. Imagine a scenario where a person's well-being is monitored beyond the ordinary â€“ not just heartbeats, but even the unexpected. Free fall events, those moments when someone needs help the most, are now under the vigilant watch of our technology.

## Project Proposal

### Goal

The goal of this project is to emulate a health tracker capable of monitoring pulse rate (heartbeats) and detecting free falls. The captured data is then sent to a smartphone application via Bluetooth Low Energy protocol. The pulse rates are captured using a pulse rate sensor from Sparkfun, while free falls are detected using an accelerometer.

## High-Level Requirements

1. The system consists of a server (Blue Gecko) and a client (mobile phone).
2. The Blue Gecko board advertises GATT services.
3. GATT service includes characteristics for free fall detection (accelerometer) and heart rate sensing (pulse rate sensor).
4. Values are sent to the cellphone client every 10 seconds.
5. Encrypted link established between server and client via bonding.
6. Server sends values to the client every 10 seconds before entering sleep mode.
7. Server operates in the lowest possible energy mode.
8. Communication between server and client uses BLE.
9. Client displays received free fall and pulse rate values.
10. Server's LCD displays connection status and current indications.
11. Client's application displays free fall and pulse rate values.

## High-Level Design

The project consists of a server (Blue Gecko board) and a client (Bluetooth-based mobile app). The server measures free fall and pulse rate values, which are transmitted to the client via BLE.
